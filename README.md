# Cafelingua - platform to manage offline education centres
Made this project when I was learning Python / flask. Uses MySQL as database on the backend.

### Features
- Register multiple centers
- Register faculties and students
- attendance marking for teachers and students
- timetable for students
- teachers can upload downloadable material (need to integrate S3 for better scale)
- incomplete library feature.
